Do you like the Game of Life? Do you like the Lotka-Volterra equations? Then you will love the 2D- Lotka-Volterra Game of Life!

A very simple game I made to show the interesting effects of multiple cells, each running the Lotka-Volterra equations, with the effective number of prey and predators depending on all neighboring cells. It seems the effect generated generally tends to be waves, spreading out. Walls can be added in, in order to see how this changes the patterns. Basically just a little vignette to play with.
